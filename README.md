# Kmeans-Approach

This code can be used to classify batter approach by Swing%, Z-Swing%, and O-Swing% using data from fangraphs. An example dataset is also included in the repository but for current statistics new data will need to be downloaded from the fangraphs leaderboard page. Instructions on the format of the data is included in the R file.

K-means code is adapted from https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html
